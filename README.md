# CNN based Object Classification 
Computer Vision Project (CS/RBE 549 at WPI)

The goal of our project was to compare car recognition accuracy between convolutional networks and systems that used traditional computer vision methods. We also aimed to compare how their accuracy changed when they were tested with different augmented images.

To achieve the goal of our project, we firstly prepared a dataset of images. For classification purposes, this dataset consisted of two types of images: images that contained cars in different orientations, and images that did not contain any cars. We preprocessed these images by converting them to grayscale before using them.
